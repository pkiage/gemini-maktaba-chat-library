# Privacy Policy for Maktaba

**Effective Date:** [Insert Today's Date]

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

Maktaba ("The Extension") is designed to prioritize user privacy. The Extension does not collect, transmit, or sell any user data to the developer or any third parties.

**We do not have access to your personal information, chat history, or login credentials.**

## 2. Local and Synced Storage

The Extension stores your data (folder structures, tags, chat titles, and notes) using Chrome's built-in storage system (`chrome.storage.sync`).

* **Purpose:** This allows your library organization to sync across your signed-in Chrome devices automatically.
* **Security:** This data is associated with your Google Account and handled according to Google's privacy policies for Chrome Sync. The developer cannot access this data.

## 3. Permissions

* **Host Permissions:** The extension accesses `https://gemini.google.com/*` strictly to inject the sidebar interface and read the metadata (Title and URL) of the chats you explicitly choose to save. It does not read the content of your conversations unless you export them.
* **Storage:** Used solely to save your organization preferences locally on your device.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The Extension operates entirely within your browser. It does not communicate with external servers, analytics tools, or tracking scripts.

## 5. Contact
